# pi_calculation

This program allows to compute pi number based on a square with a side of a given number by counting how many points will be randomly selected within the quarter of a circle with a radius equating this square's side length.

SquareSide specifies the length of a square in question. 
Increasing this number will increase both the computing time and accuracy.
